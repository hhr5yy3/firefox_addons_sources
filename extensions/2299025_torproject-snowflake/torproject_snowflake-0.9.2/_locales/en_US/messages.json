This metadata is, exhaustively: the IP address of the proxy (your IP address), your reported NAT type, the version of the snowflake protocol you (the proxy) is running, the fact that the proxy (the addon you have installed) is a webextension, and the number of clients already connected to the proxy (to the addon you have installed). This data is used only for the establishment of the connection and aggregate statics and is not stored at the broker.
