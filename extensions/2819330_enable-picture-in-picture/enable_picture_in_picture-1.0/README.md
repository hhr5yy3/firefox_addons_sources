Enable Picture-in-Picture

Description:

Unlock the full potential of your web browsing experience with the Enable PiP Firefox addon. This addon ensures that the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature is enabled on all video elements across websites, even if they have been explicitly disabled by the website owners.


Features:

    Automatic Activation: As soon as a webpage with video elements loads, the addon activates the PiP feature.

    Dynamic Monitoring: Using MutationObserver, this addon keeps an eye on DOM changes, ensuring that even newly added video elements get the PiP feature enabled.

    Efficient Performance: Built for speed and low CPU usage, this addon works silently in the background without affecting your browsing experience.



How It Works:

When a webpage with disabled PiP features on its video elements is detected, Enable PiP will:

    1. Remove the disablepictureinpicture attribute from the video element.
    2. Temporarily adjust the video's dimensions to trigger an immediate layout recalculation, making the changes take effect instantly.


Installation:

Simply download the Enable PiP addon from the Firefox Addon marketplace and let it run in the background to ensure an uninterrupted Picture-in-Picture experience.


Privacy:

Enable PiP doesn't collect or store any user data. It runs entirely on your local machine and doesn't interact with external servers for its functionality.
