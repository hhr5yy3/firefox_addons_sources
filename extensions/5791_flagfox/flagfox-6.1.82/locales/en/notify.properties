# do not translate "network.proxy.socks_remote_dns":
msg.proxy=Your current proxy settings do not allow local DNS requests. (network.proxy.socks_remote_dns) Flagfox uses an internal IP address location database to look up server locations and thus will not be able to do so without the ability to look up IP addresses via DNS. Flag icon updating and any actions which rely on looked up IP addresses or locations will be unavailable.

msg.stale=Your installed version of Flagfox is now more than a few months old. Flagfox uses an internal IP address location database to look up server locations and thus some shown flags will begin to get progressively more inaccurate until you update to the current version.

msg.tld=Note: Flagfox has determined that this webserver is in %1$S, however the address ends in "%2$S" (%3$S). Flagfox locates servers using their IP addresses via an internal database and does not rely on TLD codes such as this. Servers need not be located in the origin nation of the site and thus this is not likely to be an error.
