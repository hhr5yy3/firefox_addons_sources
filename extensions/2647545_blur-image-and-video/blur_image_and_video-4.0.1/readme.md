## fire fox version

has some differences in how it calls the browser apis such as `browser.xxx` rather than `chrome.xxx`

background script is a script not a service worker

need to zip the contents of the entire directory before you can add it as a temporary add on in firefox

Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
