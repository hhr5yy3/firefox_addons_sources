   About the French Spelling Standards 
_______________________________________________________________________________


   In 1990, The French High Council for the tongue And The French Academia
   wrote a French Spelling Reform who is about to change the way french are spelling thousands of french words.However this political reform is informative only. The French Elders and the younger one can spell a same word differently according to the way they had learnt it. Either spelling the Old fashion or the new one are valid.

 It could be seen as chaotic from an outside view. However people are spelling more like most others do. So it stay elegant and Changes from New Reform and old School spelling takes time to occur in day to day basis.The changes are smooth in the timeline and the 1990's reform will take a century or alike to be mainly in practice by France 's people.
