I made it because I love all the different aspects of filmmaking, because I was tired of my fear of failure, and because I wanted to see what would happen if I just finished one. Maybe this will lead to bigger and better films; maybe not. Either way I learned something. \\n\\nThe story was largely born from its constraints. It had to be doable in my free time, and I had to be able to shoot it during my vacation in Nags Head, NC\u2014with a budget of only $50, to cover the props (I\'d previously owned the Canon T2i, lenses, and Logic Pro, and used the free 30-day trial of FCPX). I wanted it to be a simple story with a mysterious twist or two.\\n\\nI got lots of advice from fellow filmmakers\u2014Andrew, Mitchell, Kyle, Brian, Shepherd, Drew, David, and others. If you like the film, thank you Andrew, Mitchell, Kyle, Brian, Shepherd, Drew, and David. If you thought it was rubbish, they only tried to make it better than it was. And thanks again to Abbie and Gabe, without whose talents I couldn\'t have made it. \\n\\nSome have asked about Emily; the film wasn\'t written about her (she passed away while it was in post-production), but she was a dear friend of my family and many others, and it was an honor to dedicate it to her memory. \\n\\nMany of you know far more about filmmaking than I do, so please feel free to offer any critique.\\n\\nThe Lights Film School blog interviewed me about the making of the film and overcoming fear of failure: http://www.lightsfilmschool.com/blog/short-film-canon-t2i-low-budget/1780/\\n\\n\\nFILM FESTIVALS\\n- HollyShorts\\n- DC Shorts\\n- Beloit International Film Festival\\n- Fire Reel Film Festival\\n- Blue Lab Creative Industries Symposium\\n- Juggernaut Film Festival\\n- Shortcutz International Short Film Exhibition\\n- Rochester Museum of Fine Arts Short Film Series\\n- Filmbooth International Short Film Screening (Gurgaon, India)\\n- Surrey International Film Festival\\n- Winner, Best of Fest, Fandana Film Festival\\n- Festival du Film de Vacances\\n- Low Country Indie Shorts\\n- Choice Cuts (London)\\n- Write.Shoot.Cut\\n- MudasFest\\n- Shortlisted for the Forster Film Festival\\n- ClujShorts International Short Film Festival\\n- Love Fest\\n\\n\\nFEATURED\\n- PBS Digital Studios Top 5 No Budget Short Films\\n- Short of the Week\\n- planet5D\\n- Digital Convergence podcast (http://tinyurl.com/l3a5jxml)\\n- PetaPixel\\n- Impossible Project\\n- FSTOPPERS \\n- Film School Rejects\\n- Directors Notes\\n- Making the Movie\\n- Charlotte Viewpoint\\n- The Veda House\\n- Movie Playoffs Favorite Shorts\\n- New American Storytellers Screening Room\\n- WriteShootCut\\n- Independent Filmmakers Channel\\n- 01SHORTFILM Channel\\n-\xa0200+ additional blogs\\n\\nAlso used in Basic Cinematography and Reflexive Film classes at universities including Syracuse.\\n\\n------------------------\\n\\nDirector / DP / Editor / Composer / Colorist / Sound Designer / Foley: PETER LEWIS\\nGirl: ABBIE LEWIS\\nBoy: GABE LEWIS\\n\\n------------------------\\n\\nCamera: Canon Rebel EOS 550D T2i\\nLenses: Canon 50mm 1.4, Tamron 28-200mm\\nEditing / Color Grading: Final Cut Pro X\\nSound Design / Foley / Original Score: Logic Pro 9\\nPolaroid film: The Impossible Project","created_time":"2011-11-25T06:11:48+00:00","pictures":[{"type":"thumbnail","width":1280,"height":720,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/221227664_1280.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":960,"height":540,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/221227664_960.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":640,"height":360,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/221227664_640.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":295,"height":166,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/221227664_295x166.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":200,"height":150,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/221227664_200x150.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":100,"height":75,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/221227664_100x75.jpg"}],"user":{"uri":"/users/2923600","name":"Peter Lewis"}},{"uri":"/videos/7563705","name":"The Laundromat | Short Film","description":"cast ELIZA TAYLOR and TIM ROSS\\nwriter director TIMOTHY MELVILLE\\nproducer DOMINIC ALLEN\\ncinematographer JOEL BETTS\\nproduction company SCARAB STUDIO FILMS. 2009\\n\\nDownload the script here, http://tinyurl.com/kezzws4\\nView the Spanish dub here, http://youtu.be/eYTJdv0JMhw\\n\\nOfficial Selection Flickerfest 2010\\nOfficial Selection St Kilda Film Festival 2010\\nOfficial Selection Dungog Film Festival 2010\\nWinner Best Film Hillside Film Festival 2010\\nWinner Best Film Bohemian Shorts 2010\\nWinner Best Film Bayside Film Festival 2010\\nWinner Best New Filmmaker Shepparton Shorts 2010\\nWinner Best Script In The Bin Short Film Festival 2010\\nFinalist Aesthetica Short Film Competition 2010 (UK)\\nOfficial Selection Bodega Bay Film Festival 2011 (USA)\\nOfficial Selection Southern Screen Film Festival 2011 (USA)\\n\\nThe Laundromat is distributed by Flickerfest\\n\\nhttp://timothymelville.com","created_time":"2009-11-12T01:28:03+00:00","pictures":[{"type":"thumbnail","width":1280,"height":640,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/133977185_1280.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":960,"height":480,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/133977185_960.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":640,"height":320,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/133977185_640.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":295,"height":166,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/133977185_295x166.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":200,"height":150,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/133977185_200x150.jpg"},{"type":"thumbnail","width":100,"height":75,"link":"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/133977185_100x75.jpg"}],"user":{"uri":"/users/2621541","name":"Timothy Melville"}},{"uri":"/videos/44185686","name":"Suckablood -
