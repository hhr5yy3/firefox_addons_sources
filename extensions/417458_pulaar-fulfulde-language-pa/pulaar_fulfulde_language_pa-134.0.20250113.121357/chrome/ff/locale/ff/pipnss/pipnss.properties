# It's possible to verify the length of a translation using the Browser Console

# (new TextEncoder('utf-8').encode('YOURSTRING')).length
#
# Simply replace YOURSTRING with your translation.

# If it's not possible to produce an understandable translation within these
# limits, keeping the English text is an acceptable workaround.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (SSLConnectionErrorPrefix2): %1$S is the host string, %2$S is more detailed information (localized as well).
SSLConnectionErrorPrefix2=An error occurred during a connection to %1$S. %2$S\n
certErrorTrust_MitM=Your connection is being intercepted by a TLS proxy. Uninstall it if possible or configure your device to trust its root certificate.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMismatchSinglePrefix): %S is replaced by the domain for which the certificate is valid
certErrorMismatchSinglePrefix=The certificate is only valid for %S.
certErrorMitM=Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMitM2): %S is brandShortName
certErrorMitM2=%S is backed by the non-profit Mozilla, which administers a completely open certificate authority (CA) store. The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMitM3): %S is brandShortName
certErrorMitM3=%S uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.
certErrorSymantecDistrustAdministrator=You may notify the website’s administrator about this problem.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorCodePrefix3): %S is replaced by the error code.
certErrorCodePrefix3=Error code: %S
