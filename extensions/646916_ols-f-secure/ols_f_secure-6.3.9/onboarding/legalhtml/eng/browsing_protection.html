	 <p class="p">We check the URLs (web page addresses) of the web pages that you open,
		the URLs referred to from the web pages that you open, and keep track of the
		browser tabs that you open and close. This information is passed on to the
		F-Secure security product that you have installed on your computer. The
		security product sends queries about the URLs to F-Secure Security Cloud to
		obtain security ratings for the URLs; based on the obtained security ratings,
		Browsing Protection by F-Secure then blocks access to web pages that are rated
		as harmful, suspicious, illegal, or (if the security product is so configured)
		unsuitable for children. Tracking of opened and closed browser tabs is
		restricted to your computer for the purpose of keeping track of your secured
		banking sessions; we do not forward information about your browser's tabs to
		F-Secure Security Cloud.
	 </p>
 
	 <p class="p">If the installed security product is so configured, Browsing Protection
		by F-Secure modifies internet search queries (for example, using Google or
		Bing) to force the searches to be run in "Safe Search" mode, blocking sexually
		explicit content like pornography, violence, and gore from the search results.
	 </p>
 
	 <p class="p">When you search the internet using Google, Bing, and other search
		engines, we check the URLs of your search results and, as above, query their
		security ratings from F-Secure Security Cloud. We then modify the search
		results page by inserting "rating icons" next to your search results, allowing
		you to see which links in the search results are safe, harmful, suspicious,
		illegal, or unsuitable for children.
	 </p>
 
	 <p class="p">Browsing Protection by F-Secure only monitors and collects the URLs
		being opened and those being referred to from the web pages that you open. We
		do not read or modify any other part of the contents of the web pages that you
		open except for the URLs contained within them and the search results for the
		purpose of inserting "rating icons" as stated above.
	 </p>
 
	 <p class="p">The URLs that you open or that are contained within the web pages that
		you open are forwarded to F-Secure Security Cloud (for the purposes stated
		above) anonymously, without any information that would allow us to identify you
