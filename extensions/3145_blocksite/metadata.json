        "en-US": "Unfortunately Noel Briggs wasn't able to co-maintain this add-on, so I took over again. Please donate if you would like to see BlockSite updated regularly.\n\n2010/02/01: The first donation pledge of $50 was reached in less than two weeks. Thanks to all who've donated. I will be working on a major update (with probably much faster execution and certainly with less bugs). This can take a while, so don't worry if you will not see the major update shortly.\n\n2010/02/12: I've been working on the long awaited update for a few days now. Unfortunately it needs complete restructuring with completely new code, because most of it buggy or just plain old. Thanks to all who have donated so far."
