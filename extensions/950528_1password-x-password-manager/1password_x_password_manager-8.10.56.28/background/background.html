			Webkit has a bug in iOS 17 that prevents background scripts
			from resuming after they've been suspended. This bug does
			not manifest when a message handler has been registered in
			the background from a non module script. Therefore we must
			keep health-check.js as a non-module script until we drop
			support for iOS 17.
