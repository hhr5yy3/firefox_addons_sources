## MobiDevTools

Considering Firefox the only browser for Android that offers the possibility of being able to install add-ons, I believe that implementing Eruda, mobile devtools, in a WebExtension was for me a necessary choice for developers who concentrate on debugging web apps. Add-on allows you to view the console, DOM elements, network traffic, source code, resources, and more.

Â»`Click the WebExtension's icon in the toolbar or menu to open the overlay.`

### Main Features
* Console * View JavaScript logs, errors, warnings, and other debug info. Execute arbitrary JS to interact with the webpage.
* Inspect into the DOM tree to see attributes, inline styles, CSS rules, and computed styles.
* Exploring in detail the network requests being made and inspect the responses.
* Resource * Show HTML5 Local Storage, HTML5 Session Storage, cookies, scripts, stylesheets, iframes, and image assets.
* Source code viewer for HTML, JS, and CSS.
* View the current URL, User Agent, and device details.
* Execute useful JavaScript snippets.
* Manage basic and advanced options directly in devtools

### Limitations
* WebExtension only works on sites that allow content scripts.
