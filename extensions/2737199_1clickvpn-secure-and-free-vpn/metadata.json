Introduction about private internet connection and areas of its use.

During the usage of a public wi-fi, VPN helps to keep your data safe from hackers and malware and protect data from unauthorized access.\n\n\nHow does VPN work?\n\nVPN sends your data through the encrypted tunnel that makes your connection private and securely. While you connect to one of our remote servers your real ip address is masked and all data goes securely to the final destination. \n\nVPN connection broadens a private network over a public network and allows users to send and receive requests over public networks as if their computers are directly connected to the private network.\n\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN connection?\n\nVPN connection uses the modern data encryption protocols.

A VPN connection hides your data traffic online and protects it from unwanted access. While you browse without a VPN connection the data can be viewed by anyone who has an intention to see it. With VPN, hackers and intruders cannot decrypt this data.\n\nCan I use a VPN server privately?\n\nVPN service provides private browser sessions, as with VPN connection your online activity is not stored or tracked and your IP address and physical location are hidden. All data and requests you send via encrypted network tunnel is securely shield from hackers and illegal trackers.
