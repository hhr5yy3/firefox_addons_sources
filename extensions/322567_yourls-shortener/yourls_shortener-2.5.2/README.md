# YOURLS Firefox extension

This is an extension for Mozilla's Firefox to interact with the open source [URL shortener Yourls](http://yourls.org/).
This page is just a stub and just contains a few screenshots. You will find [more information on the plugin's website](https://binfalse.de/software/browser-extensions/yourls-firefox-webextension/) and at [Mozilla's add-on platform](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yourls-shortener/).

## Key features

* passwordless authentication
* provide a keyword for the short URL
* selected text on the web page to use it as keyword
* automatically copy the resulting short URL to your clipboard


## Required Permissions

* *Access data for all web sites:* The extension needs access to the current website to get the URL and potentially selected text (for keyword suggestions), and the extension needs to access any other URL to communicated with private YOURLS instances.
* *Input data to the clipboard:* The extension is able to copy the shortened URL to clipboard (can be configured in the extension's preferences)
