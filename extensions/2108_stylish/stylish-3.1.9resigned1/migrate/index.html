    <div id="subtitle">
        <p>This version includes a huge design and infrastructure update, making us fully compatible with the new Firefox
            WebExtension guidelines.</p>

        <p>As part of the upgrade to WebExtension we had to migrate your installed styles to the new version. Most of the
            styles were successfully migrated, but we could not transfer some user settings in certain instances. If you had
            edited an existing style, or created your own, it may not have been transferred to the new version. Therefore,
            we have created an easy way for you to migrate the CSS from your previously installed styles to the new
            version:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Simply go to the section below (Style Migration) and find the style you want to migrate.</li>
            <li>For migrating an edited style, copy the CSS, go to <a href="/manage.html" target="_blank">Manage All Styles
                page</a>, click on "Edit" next to the style, use "Mozilla format import" and overwrite it.
            </li>
            <li>For migrating a style you created, go to <a href="/edit.html" target="_blank">Add Style page</a>, click
                "Write new style", import and save.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you did not upgrade to the previous version (v2.0.7) before updating to this version, your installed styles
            may not have been transferred at all. In this case you will have to reinstall any styles you would like to use
            from <a href="https://userstyles.org" target="_blank">userstyles.org</a>.</p>

        <p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience. We did the best we could to make this a smooth transition to a new Mozilla
            technology standard. We hope you’ll love the new version!</p>
