        <p>WCAG Contrast Checker is a browser extension that analyses the <strong>color contrast between foreground and
            background of all elements</strong> in the page.</p>
        <p>The tool can also analyse the color contrast of documents included with iframes. For accessing to their
            results, it includes a document selector that switches between all the HTML documents.</p>
        <p>The extension does not analyse the color of the images. If the element is an image, the detected color for
            the foreground is the one that its alternative text would use, and if the element includes and image as
            background, the background color is the one that it has defined without considering the image.</p>

        <h3>Visible and Hidden elements</h3>
        <p>The tool identifies the elements that use common techniques to hide content (for collapsible elements,
            fly-outs, menus, etc.). Those elements are not evaluated.</p>

        <h3>Color blindness selector</h3>
        <p>By choosing one of the color blindness options, the colors in the page will emulate that visual condition and
            the color contrast is reevaluated according to it.</p>

        <h3>Auto-refresh (refresh on DOM updates)</h3>
        <p>The analysis can be performed to be executed on every DOM modification (additions or removal of DOM elements,
            as well as on changes of class values). Although this feature gives better feedback when the page updates
            content without reload, it can also impact in the general performance.</p>

        <h3>Manual color analysis</h3>
        <p>The extension includes a color analyser that allows to introduce a color combination to evaluate its
            contrast.</p>

        <h3>Color contrast in WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)</h3>
        <p>WCAG define two levels of compliance that differ only in the contrast ratio:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level AA</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>4.5:1 for normal text</li>
                    <li>3:1 for large text</li>
                    <li>3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Level AAA</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>7:1 for normal text</li>
                    <li>4.5:1 for large text</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px, or 1.2rem when the root font is 16px) and bold or
            larger, or 18 point (typically 24px or 1.5rem) or larger.</p>
