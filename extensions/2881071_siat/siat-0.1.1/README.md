# Save-Image-as-Type "Firefox version"

## Firefox extension for "Save as PNG/JPG/WebP" right-click menu.

Save Image as Type is a Firefox extension which add Save Image as PNG / JPG / WebP option to the context menu of image.

This is a port of [Save-Image-as-Type](https://github.com/image4tools/Save-Image-as-Type). I have made some changes to make it work in Firefox.
