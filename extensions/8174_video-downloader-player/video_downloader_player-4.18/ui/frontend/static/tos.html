              <li>
                <strong>Definitions.</strong> Ant.com Ltd is the operator of the Ant.com Website. Ant.com Ltd. shall be referred to as “Company”. When first-person pronouns are used in this Agreement (Us, Our, Ours, etc.), these provisions refer to the Company and/or to any other website that We may choose to operate in the future.<br />
                <br />
                The “User” of this Website and its Services will be referred to, in this Agreement, as “You” or through a second-person pronouns, such as “Your”, etc. You certify that You are over thirteen (13) years of age and that You have received Your parent’s or guardian’s consent to enter this Agreement.<br />
                <br />
                The term “Website” is used to refer to the Ant.com website published by Us. Ant.com is a search engine for Internet users also offering a selection of other Services described below.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Description of Services.</strong> Ant.com is a multi-purpose service which allows You to use or access a wealth of services including search services, add-on, traffic rankings and a broad range of other content (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are described in detail as follows:<br />
                <em>Ant Search Engine</em> &mdash; Ant.com core service is assisting You in Your web search. A Social Search Engine is coming soon allowing You to retrieve information tailored to Your personal interest by bookmarking websites as well as following other users’ bookmarks. Your bookmarks can either be set as “Private” or “Public” so as to decide, when users follow You, which bookmarks other users can view.<br />
                <em>Ant Add-on aka Ant Video Downloader</em> &mdash; is a free downloadable software, available on Your Internet Explorer or Firefox Internet browsers, allowing users to download video streams while browsing video websites. A series of features will be displayed on Ant Add-on in order to provide You with an easy access to Our Services, namely video downloader, video player, and Ant rank. The Ant Add-on collects and stores information about the webpages You view. This helps Us constitute a ranking of the traffic that websites generate over the last three months as well as compare websites’ traffic. In the eventuality that information We receive about You by the Ant Add-on Service might be personally identifiable, as privacy is important to Us, we commit to not using that web data in order to determine the identity of any of Our Users. Ant Add-on Service may, however, periodically contact Our server to provide Us information about the Ant Add-on. In addition to the standard information that Your browser sends to most any other web page You might visit, this communication also involves sending a computer-generated unique identifier that is stored in Your computer’s registry upon install and that We use for internal business purposes such as auditing or security reasons.<br />
                <em>Ant.com Ant.com addon</em> &mdash; this service offers You the opportunity to make bookmarks while You surf the web, automatically save them on Your Account and allow You to search within them later.<br />
                <em>Video Sites</em> &mdash; a selection of video streaming websites is provided to help You have a broad view of all the video streaming websites there are and enhance Your experience.<br />
                <em>Ant Support</em> &mdash; Once You register and sign in, You can submit any opinions, reviews, questions or comments about the Services, on the Ant Support. Take notice that by using the Ant Support, You agree to abide to the Rules and Guidelines of the Ant Support.
              </li>
