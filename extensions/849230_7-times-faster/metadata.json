        "en-US": "The main purpose is fast web pages loading time. So, it blocks ads and tracking. And that why you get faster internet. It allows some ads, when it takes a longer time to block them. Also, it blocks malware for your security and some inappropriate content, for a example, porn. Also, you can block social media. This option can significantly increase speed on some web pages.\n\nIf this extension blocks some site that you want to visit, just add blocked page to whitelist by clicking special button in popup after clicking on icon of 7 Times Faster.\n\n7 Times Faster is extension for users with slow internet speed. It's a free ad blocker. But, please, support us and we will improve it.\n\nI called it \"7 Times Faster\", because one of my favourite sites is loading 7.2 times faster, from 6.5 seconds to 0.9 seconds now. So I am very happy now :-)\n\nComparison of ad blockers on ten very popular web pages. If you are using no extension you get average page loading time 3.3 seconds. If you are using AdBlock \u2013 4.295 seconds - 30.15% slower than using no extension. Adblock plus \u2013 4.527 seconds - 37.18% slower. Fair AdBlocker \u2013 3.549 seconds - 7.5% slower. 7 Times Faster 2.839 seconds - 13.96% faster. Only \"7 Times Faster\" faster than no extension. So, it not only block ads as others, but also speed up your page loading time.\n\nComparison of ad blockers on typical web pages with few ads.  If you are using no extension you get average page loading time 3.292 seconds. If you are using AdBlock \u2013 3.785 seconds - 14.97% slower than using no extension. Adblock plus \u2013 3.829 seconds - 16.31% slower. Fair AdBlocker \u2013 2.538 seconds - 22.9% faster. 7 Times Faster 1.797 seconds - 45.41% faster. 7 Times Faster is fastest again. And it speed up your page loading time almost in two times.\n\nComparison of ad blockers on top ten most visited news portals.  It's a heavy sites with a lot of resources loaded. So, we get bigger page loading time values. As expected. If you are using no extension you get average page loading time 10.05 seconds. If you are using AdBlock \u2013 9.08 seconds - 9.65% faster than using no extension. Adblock plus \u2013 10.521 seconds - 4.68% slower. Fair AdBlocker \u2013 6.465 seconds - 35.67% faster, nice result! 7 Times Faster 4.244 seconds - 57.77% faster. 7 Times Faster is fastest ad blocker again. It's 2.36 times faster than no extension, 2.14 times faster than AdBlock which have 40+ millions of users. And it's 2.48 times faster than AdBlock Plus.\n\nThis extension don't track you and we prevent others from tracking you!\n\nPlease, use it on your own risk. Because, sometimes it can harm web pages. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the services\n\nUpdates:\nVersion \"1.0.0.5\"\n1. Fixed some bugs.\n2. Code optimization. Now it 5% faster than previous version.\n3. Added \"block social media\" option. Using it you can increase speed on 30% on web pages with social media buttons and etc.\n\nVersion \"1.0.0.8\"\n1. Fixed some code bugs.\n\nVersion \"1.0.0.9\"\n1. Fixed some code bugs.\n2. Changed logic of blocking social media.\n3. Many domains were deleted from blocked list"
