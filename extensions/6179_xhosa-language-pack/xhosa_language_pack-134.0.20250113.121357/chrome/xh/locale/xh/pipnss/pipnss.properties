# The following strings have special requirements: they must fit in a 32 or 64

#
# It's possible to verify the length of a translation using the Browser Console
# in Firefox and evaluating the following code:
#
# (new TextEncoder('utf-8').encode('YOURSTRING')).length
#
# Simply replace YOURSTRING with your translation.
#
# If it's not possible to produce an understandable translation within these
# limits, keeping the English text is an acceptable workaround.

certErrorIntro=%S uses an invalid security certificate.
certErrorTrust_UnknownIssuer=The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown.
certErrorTrust_CaInvalid=The certificate is not trusted because it was issued by an invalid CA certificate.
certErrorTrust_Issuer=The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.
certErrorTrust_ExpiredIssuer=The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate has expired.
certErrorTrust_Untrusted=The certificate does not come from a trusted source.
certErrorTrust_MitM=Your connection is being intercepted by a TLS proxy. Uninstall it if possible or configure your device to trust its root certificate.
certErrorMismatch=The certificate is not valid for the name %S.

certErrorMitM=Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMitM2): %S is brandShortName
certErrorMitM2=%S is backed by the non-profit Mozilla, which administers a completely open certificate authority (CA) store. The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (certErrorMitM3): %S is brandShortName
certErrorMitM3=%S uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.
certErrorSymantecDistrustAdministrator=You may notify the website’s administrator about this problem.
