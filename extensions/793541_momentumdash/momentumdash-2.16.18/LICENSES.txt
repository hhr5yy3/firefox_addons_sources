### The Short Summary, TL;DR:
Files in this repository are licensed to the W3/AGWG under their cooperative agreement for use with WCAG accessibility guidelines for web-delivered and web-based content only, and not for any other use.

Use of the terms "SAPC", "SACAM", "APCA", "Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm", "Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm", to describe any contrast method, app, or device, is only permitted for code that is correctly implemented, maintained, and up to date.

Code or implementations found to be non-compliant with the correct operation and methodology as defined for APCA contrast, including but not limited to the correct indication of polarity, and use of the current approved constants, shall be deemed in breech of license and a copyright violation.

limited basis for use in WCAG accessibility guidelines
for web content only. **apca-w3**  may be used for 
predicting contrast for web content used for that
specific purpose without royalty.

Said license excludes other use cases
not related to web content. Prohibited uses include
medical, clinical evaluation, human safety related,
aerospace, transportation, military applications, 
and uses which are not specific to web-based content
presented on self-illuminated displays or devices.

_**NO ALTERATION; KEEP CURRENT**_     
Any **apca-w3** files in this repository may be used or incorporated only in tools for web-based content or web related content in support of the WCAG accessibility guidelines, and such use must be without modification to the essential elements of the code or specific approved constants, except as required to port to a given language.

- Developers are highly encouraged to use the npm package(s) when possible:  ` npm i apca-w3 `

- Developers incorporating this code into their applications, widgets, or other tools, have a duty to ensure that the most recent version of this code is used in their current or any future release. 

- Breaking change exception:
    - developers do not need to incorporate future versions of **apca-w3** that have breaking changes when their release is only a minor or patch version per semantic versioning.
    - developers with minor or patch revisions are still obligated to use the latest non-breaking branch of **apca-w3**.
    - developers with a major revision per semantic versioning are obligated to use the most recent stable **apca-w3**.

- Use of the acronyms APCA or SAPC, or the terms "Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm", "Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm", or "Readability Contrast", to describe any embodyment or instantiation of contrast determination, method, or math, including the APCA code base or libraries, **is only permitted for code that is properly implementing the APCA algorithm, and maintaining sync with the current version. At this writing, current base algorithm version 0.0.98G-4g or later. **

_**USE OF THE APCA LOGO AND TRADEMARK**_     
- Use of the APCA logo as shown at this repo to describe any contrast app, use, or method, or the "Powered by APCA" logo, and/or any related official logos or trademearks, **are prohibited without written consent** from Myndex™ Technologies, Myndex™ Research, Andrew Somers, and/or the authorized agents or assigns.
