    <h2>Now you can leverage additional security when storing your accounts in DWithEase</h2>
    <h3>The OnePass can encrypt all other accounts using a single pass phrase</h3>

    <p>Like a lot of password managers, we have the following approach:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Zero-knowledge policy</b> - after password encryption with AES-256 bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256
            and salted hashes no one has access to the passwords unless he has the OnePass</li>
        <li><b>OnePass</b> - this is a pass phrase entered on occasion to unlock the vault and gain access to
            all stored passwords</li>
        <li><b>Limited time user sessions</b> - the OnePass unlocks the vault for a limited period of time (e.g.
            30 minutes), after that period the vault is locked and the user is prompted for the OnePass again
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>We now use <a href="https://github.com/crypto-browserify/pbkdf2">PBKDF2</a> to encrypt the passwords opened with
        the OnePass.</p>

    <p>The aim is to provide additional security that will reassure you of the safety practices we employ.</p>

    <p>You can also, if needed, remove the OnePass if you choose to stop using this feature.</p>

    <p>All passwords stored in the extensions are accessible only within an opened session ranging between [ 15-30 mins, 1-2-4 hours, or until browser closed ] during which the password will be stored in the background execution context. You can lock the OnePass at any time, using the padlock in the pop-up window.</p>
