Enjoy!\n\n\nI started this project because I was looking for a way to add sticky notes while I was creating a webpage for a customer and I wanted to create a note that I could read from my computer at home as well as from my computer at the office.\n\nA few of the current features:\n<ol><li>you can create a note on any web page with a simple right click on the page</li><li>you can personalize the look of the notes: color, font-size, position, and size</li><li>you can minimize the note</li><li>all the notes will sync between browsers that use the same account</li><li>the notes will auto-load on the page</li><li>you can view all the notes created by clicking on the main icon</li><li>you can decide if a note is for the exact URL or page or for the full domain or always present</li><li>ability to login with Facebook or Google</li><li>share a sticky between users thanks to CHANNELS</li><li>ability to tag a note (this is in beta)</li><li>edit a Sticky and you will see the changes apply to all the other computers that have access to the stickys almost in real time (great for presentations)</li><li>pin a note to a position so it will ignore scrolling</li><li>convert a sticky into a TO-DO list (or format a JSON string)</li><li>choose the default settings for all the new stickys</li><li>leave stickys on PDF files</li><li>drag and drop text from any program into a sticky</li><li>YouTube video playback built directly into a sticky</li><li>Shortcuts: ALT+Shift+S to add a sticky, or configure your preferred one</li><li>Export and Import Stickys</li><li>... and much more ...</li></ol>\n<b>PRIVACY</b>\nPrivacy is very important to us. We do not store any sensitive information and we make sure that the information is not accessible by anyone. No third party web application, nowhere to register, nobody to trust your data with.\n\nNO DATA in any form will be shared with anyone.\n\n<b>ADS FREE</b>\nNobody likes ads, we know that. This extension does not display any ad, or anything else that is not sticker added by you.\n\n<b>PERMISSIONS</b>\nWe need to read your current tab URL so that we know where you added a new sticky. This information is then stored together with the text and other settings so that we know where we need to show it again once you open that page.\n\n<b>NOTE</b>\nThe extension won't work on pages locked by Firefox.\n\nOurStickys wants to be the new way for dev teams or teachers/students to interact and communicate with each other about webpages.\n\nI have been a web-developer for years and something I always missed was a direct way to know what people want on a specific page, often someone takes a screen shot and then open it on paint, adds a few notes here and there, open an email (or any other communication tool), attach the image (or images), write the message, and finally sends it without the ability to edit what was sent.\n\nWhat I am building tries to remove all of that, right click anywhere on the page and add a note, share it with the people that need to read it, and you are done. No need to find which of the thousands of ways to communicate they use and no need to open different programs.\n\nMy goal is to let the browser handle everything without the need to switch tabs or leave the page. This will also help keeping yourself more focused on the problem and less on figuring out how to reach the other person.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know."
