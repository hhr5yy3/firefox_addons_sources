        "en-US": "<strong>We're finally back!</strong>\n\nDownThemAll will help you select, queue, sort and run your downloads faster. It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just OneClick!\n\nAdvanced users will also like using renaming masks, which let you automatically assign names (and even sub-folders within your downloads folder), fast-filtering or even custom, re-usable filters.\n\nDownThemAll is open-source and free. We spend a lot of time making it, and keep spending a lot of time improving it, and even fixing some problems in Firefox itself so DownThemAll! can work even better.\nWe will never add adware, spyware, user tracking or other nasty stuff. Therefore we rely on your donations exclusively to fund the development.\n\n<strong>We are looking for people willing to help translate DownThemAll! to more languages</strong>. For a small guide on how to do that, please see <a href=\"https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/9cdeb887262acb591bf1cccdad96178d5e18c702a3cd9a02c3c6942a0ae38cd4/https%3A//github.com/downthemall/downthemall/blob/master/_locales/Readme.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">our preliminary translation guide</a>. You will get our gratitude, and the gratitude of all the users whose live you improved by bringing DownThemAll! to their language.\n\n<strong>Please do NOT report any bugs and issues in the user review section</strong>, but <a href=\"https://prod.outgoing.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/v1/c0aa54294d418ba94203299d1052cd4ce712a063356f26cb600e3cdd7b4384be/https%3A//github.com/downthemall/downthemall/issues\" rel=\"nofollow\">file a bug report</a> instead. This is the only way to make sure we actually see it, and it also makes communicating to us/with you a lot easier. Thanks\n\n<strong>Please note:</strong> Version 4 of DownThemAll! is.a complete rewrite as a WebExtension, as the old add-on system was abandoned and disabled in Firefox. This was mozilla's decision, and there is nothing we can do about it. We are therefore limited to the tools the WebExtensions model provides to us, which sadly makes it impossible to provide some of the advanced features of DownThemAll! Version 3. Furthermore there are some bugs in Firefox that affect DownThemAll! as well, e.g. downloads will always succeed even if the server returns an error, but I fixed this in upcoming Firefox 71.\nHowever, we're still able to provide the advanced selection, queuing, file naming options of the old DownThemAll! and a lot more."
